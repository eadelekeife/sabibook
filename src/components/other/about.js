                                <p>Ben and Dan loved serving these users, because understanding small
                                    businesses is in their DNA: Ben grew up helping his mom around her
                                    hair salon that she ran from their family kitchen, and Dan’s parents
                                    ran a bakery. With Mailchimp, they found that working for small
                                    businesses gave them the freedom to be more creative and adapt quickly
                                    to their needs. So, in 2007, Ben and Dan decided to shutter the web
                                    design agency and focus exclusively on Mailchimp.

                                    taught us that Mailchimp’s brand promise is to help small businesses
                                    “look pro and grow,” no matter the channel.
